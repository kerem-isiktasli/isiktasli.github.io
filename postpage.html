                <h3>Silicon Valley</h3>
                <p>When I came San Francisco/California, I would have to go Silicon Valley especialy Apple Main Center.  Had chance to visit Apple's massive center and even talk with an Apple technician ,which is from Turkey, about this gorgeus building and working opportunuties.He told me that for Apple's hiring standarts is not includes University diploma.I had been suprized for all day cause in Turkey companies and hiring workers cares it too much. So I suprized, but I did not came Silicon Valley just for Apple Center. I had chance to see nearly all big companies like Google, Intel, Netflix, Facebook etc. Generally I thought that Silicon Valley as a massive building :D. But it's almost an city.(An important information: when we go to see Netflix's building, they asked that do we have allow or rezervation. We suprized and sayed that we do not have allow or rezervation.The worker expel us outside of building so we couldn't seen Netflix's building :D)</p>
            
                <h3>Stanford University</h3>
                <p>It's from Stanford University. I had traveled all around the Campus and I love it! When I talk with myself like hope I can accept by such a school like that, I met someone who is a teacher in Stanford University field in Physics again from Turkey. I had proud with my country again and again. He showed us Every single place in the campus and nearly region But the most important thing that I had opportunity to own, What is important in order to accept by Stanford.He gave me So valuable knowledge comes from years of experience. Soo one more thing, I had chance to met some group of people who studing in Stanford. I asked they my questions and they easly answer it.It was just perfect.Hope one day I accepted such a beatiful school like Stanford.</p>

                <h3>Our Robot</h3>
                <p>Of course the main topic of America travel is competition. So we had hard times of building robot.Because mostly team members were new and tring to learn what have to do. Those responsible for making robots were less in number like approximately me and my older friend. Unluckly we were poor team comes cause we are just new and anatolian high school and goverment doesn't financialy helped. We had to make the things and it was just us and our mentor Teacher Ali Kemal Alemdaroğlu. Soo that time we learned many things cause we have competitions but we dont have money also we had to represent our country in the America on best way.We did our best for this by going to fairs and making our name known and finding sponsors, and we finally succeeded.When we came to the end, all we got from the 6-month adventure was the sense of achievement. We succeeded regardless of the opportunities we had and we would represent our country in America. We were very excited. Then we boarded the plane.</p>
            
                
                
                <p>we succesfuly landed in the United states Of America. Had discovered enviroment near area and people of course.Finally competition day came up.We set up our robot and got ready for the competition. We had ran all the pit for met our teammates.Talked about creativ tactics for win. We had many matches and of course wons and lostes.Final chart is 39th in The oregon and not just that. We had a prize name of team spirit.It was important cause just a couple of team won prize soo its important for us.</p>

                <p>Competition consist of 3 stage name of drone, robotic arm and line tracker. In order of stages, first contest drone competition, game logic is start drone and make it plant 16 herb fastest I can done with code.Code language is nearly python but logic is kinda different cause riders engineers created the language. I want you to examine the code so you could understand. I'll add robotic arm codes and simulation to examine.</p>
                
                <h3>What we have done ? </h3>
                <p>On the original website indroduce they self like: Riders is an educational platform where you can experience the technologies of the 21st century, especially robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, with real-world simulations and find content based on STEM principles. So to put it briefly Riders provide us improving and developing our skills about robotics,image processing,algorithm etc. I'm also interested on coding,IP and artifical intelligence so I said myself "Kerem you have to be in such a project" so I'm here. So I'm going to put a simple example about codes and which tasks we had complete succesfully and also that our missions and finish times of course. So click the content name of software for all the details.</p>

                <p> In order to go to America, we needed to find our own sponsors, not just build robots, and we thought that the way to do this would be with the take-off event organized by the T3 foundation and we went to Istanbul Technical University. In fact, to put it simply, take off is an investment finding event for startup companies. Our reason for joining was to find our own sponsors from the big companies there, and we not only achieved our goal but also promoted our team and school on national news channels.</p>
